# Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)

**Global Reference Governance Architecture & Knowledge Centre**  
**Version 1.0 – Foundation Edition**

---

## 1. Purpose

EATGF is a vendor-neutral, standards-aligned governance architecture designed to provide a structured and traceable model for:

- **Enterprise IT Governance** – Infrastructure, systems, and technology controls
- **Information Security Governance** – Aligned with ISO/IEC 27001:2022
- **AI Governance** – Aligned with ISO/IEC 42001:2023 and NIST AI RMF
- **API Governance** – Security and lifecycle management (OWASP-aligned)
- **Risk & Assurance Models** – Assessment frameworks and audit methodology

This repository serves as the **Authoritative Knowledge Centre Edition** of the framework. It provides governance architecture, structured control definitions, cross-standard alignment, adoption guidance, and reference implementations for organizations of varying sizes and maturity levels.

---

## 2. Scope

This repository includes:

✅ **Master Control Matrix** – Single authoritative control inventory (35 controls across 7 COBIT domains)

✅ **ISO-aligned Management System Specifications** – ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001:2022) and AIMS (ISO/IEC 42001:2023)

✅ **Cross-standard Mapping Architecture** – COBIT ↔ ISO ↔ NIST alignment matrices

✅ **Governance Maturity and Performance Models** – Capability assessment frameworks and KPI definitions

✅ **Policy Architecture Examples** – Governance charters and formal policy templates

✅ **Domain-specific Governance Extensions** – AI and API governance frameworks

✅ **Audit and Assurance Framework Design** – Methodology aligned with ISO 19011:2018

**This repository does not include:**

❌ Operational tooling (no Excel, SharePoint, or deployment scripts)

❌ Vendor-specific configurations

❌ Organization-specific execution playbooks

❌ Deployment automation

---

## 3. Architectural Principles

EATGF is built on seven core architectural principles:

1. **Single Control Authority** – The Master Control Matrix serves as the sole control source of truth; no alternative control taxonomies

2. **Standards Traceability** – Every control and policy maps to recognized international standards (ISO, COBIT, NIST)

3. **Governance Before Tooling** – Architectural decisions precede technology selection; no vendor lock-in

4. **Architecture Before Execution** – Supply the governance model; organizations implement according to their context

5. **Vendor Neutrality** – Framework operates independently of any commercial platform or proprietary solution

6. **Audit Defensibility** – All controls defensible against external audit standards and regulatory frameworks

7. **Scalable Governance Models** – Single architecture adapts to startups, SaaS, and large regulated enterprises

---

## 5. Standards Alignment

EATGF structurally aligns with leading international governance frameworks:

| Standard | Scope | EATGF Alignment |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **COBIT 2019** | IT investment & risk management | Control mapping (7 domains, 35 controls) |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | Information security management | ISMS manual + Annex A controls + SoA template |
| **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** | AI governance & risk management | AIMS manual + 7-area AI lifecycle framework |
| **ISO 19011:2018** | Audit methodology | Internal audit procedure design |
| **ISO 31000** | Risk management framework | Risk assessment methodology + definitions |
| **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** | AI governance | Control alignment + lifecycle integration |
| **NIST SP 800-53** | Information security controls | Cross-reference mapping to COBIT/ISO |
| **OWASP API Security Top 10** | API security governance | Domain framework alignment |

**Important Note:** EATGF respects the intellectual property rights of all referenced standards. The framework does not reproduce proprietary standard content and does not claim certification equivalence.

## 6. Adoption Model

EATGF is designed for organizations of varying sizes and maturity levels:

**Foundational Support:**
- Startups (essential governance foundation)
- SaaS organizations (security & compliance baseline)
- Medium-sized enterprises (scalable governance)
- Large regulated enterprises (audit-defensible architecture)

**Governance Adaptation Factors:**

Organizations adapt EATGF based on:

- **Organizational size** – Startup vs. enterprise governance complexity
- **Regulatory exposure** – Industry-specific compliance requirements
- **AI usage intensity** – From minimal to mission-critical AI deployment
- **Risk profile** – Data sensitivity, criticality, and stakeholder exposure
- **Maturity level** – Initial to optimized capability progression

**Implementation Philosophy:** EATGF supplies the governance architecture and structuring models. Implementation decisions remain organization-specific and context-dependent.

---

## 7. Versioning Policy

**Version Progression Model:**

- **Structural modifications** (architecture changes, domain additions) → Major version increment (v2.0+)
- **Control clarifications, policy updates** → Minor increment (v1.1, v1.2)
- **Documentation improvements, examples** → Patch increment (v1.0.1)

**Baseline Immutability:** Versions tagged in git are immutable. All structural governance specifications are locked at tag time.
