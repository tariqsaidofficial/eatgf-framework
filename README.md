# Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)

Official Authority Repository

---

## Overview

The Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF) is a vendor-neutral, audit-defensible, control-centric governance architecture designed to align enterprise technology, AI systems, and operational controls with international standards.

This repository is the **single source of authority** for:

- Master Control Matrix (MCM)
- Information Security Management System (ISO/IEC 27001:2022)
- AI Management System (ISO/IEC 42001:2023)
- Internal Audit Methodology (ISO 19011:2018)
- Evidence Integrity & Repository Controls
- Cross-Standard Control Mappings

Public documentation is derived from this authority repository.

---

## Architecture Model

EATGF is built on a unified control authority model:

- **Core Layer** → Master Control Matrix (35 Controls)
- **Management Layer** → ISMS + AIMS
- **Assurance Layer** → Internal Audit Framework
- **Operational Layer** → Evidence Register & Integrity Controls
- **Mapping Layer** → COBIT, ISO, NIST, OWASP alignment

All governance artifacts reference the MCM as the control authority.

No duplication of controls exists outside the MCM.

## Standards Alignment

EATGF aligns with:

- COBIT 2019
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022
