## 📝 Release Notes

### New Documents Added

#### Layer 04: Enterprise Policies (5 new documents)

**Why:** EATGF v1.0 baseline was missing critical enterprise-grade policies required by customers

- **04_INCIDENT_RESPONSE_POLICY.md** – Incident severity classification, 6-phase lifecycle, SLAs, regulatory notification procedures, control mapping to ISO 27001 A.5.26
- **05_BUSINESS_CONTINUITY_AND_DISASTER_RECOVERY_POLICY.md** – RTO/RPO targets (Critical ≤4h/≤1h through Low ≤72h/≤24h), Tier 1-4 recovery architectures, quarterly testing program, crisis command structure
- **06_VENDOR_AND_THIRD_PARTY_RISK_MANAGEMENT_POLICY.md** – Vendor classification, 5-phase assessment, contract security clauses, compliance monitoring, non-compliance remediation
- **07_DATA_PRIVACY_AND_PROTECTION_POLICY.md** – Personal data classification, legal basis doctrine, data subject rights (30-day SLA), retention schedule, breach notification (72-hour GDPR), CCPA alignment
- **08_ACCEPTABLE_USE_POLICY.md** – Acceptable use principles, prohibited categories, monitoring scope and technology, investigation procedures, disciplinary framework, appeal process

**Impact:** Enables publication-ready governance completeness; enterprise customers can implement without external policy creation.

#### Layer 06: Assurance Standards (4 new documents)

**Why:** Internal audit was defined but lacked supporting standards for audit schedule, CAR tracking, certification readiness, and evidence governance

- **AUDIT_SCHEDULE_STANDARD.md** – 5-quarter rolling audit cycle, control frequency matrix, quarterly/annual roadmaps for all 35 MCM controls, resource allocation (7-8 FTE, 670 annual hours), governance committee oversight
- **CORRECTIVE_ACTION_REGISTER_STANDARD.md** – CAR data model, severity classification (Critical ≤30d, Major ≤60d, Minor ≤90d), remediation planning, closure procedures, systemic analysis, escalation triggers
- **CERTIFICATION_READINESS_CHECKLIST_STANDARD.md** – 5-section pre-audit checklist (Design Validation, Operation Readiness, Evidence Staging, Executive Certification, Exceptions), sign-offs, readiness status categories, audit efficiency metrics
- **EVIDENCE_GOVERNANCE_STANDARD.md** – Evidence classification by type/retention, centralized repository, access controls, litigation hold, chain of custody, disposal procedures, annual evidence audit

**Impact:** Enables audit program maturity; organizations can execute independent full-cycle audits.

#### Layer 08: Developer Governance Enhancement (9 new documents)

**Why:** Layer 08 was structurally complete but many subdirectories had placeholder status; v1.0-Foundation populates critical implementation standards

**03_DEVSECOPS_GOVERNANCE (5 new):**

- **CI_CD_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md** – Five-layer security model (source control, build isolation, artifact signing, deployment, monitoring), security gates (code quality, dependencies, secrets, container scan, signing, compliance), build runner hardening, artifact repository security
- **SAST_DAST_SCA_POLICY.md** – Static analysis (Bandit, SonarQube), dynamic analysis (OWASP ZAP), dependency analysis (Dependency-Check, Snyk), severity classification, false positive handling, integrated testing pipeline
- **SECRETS_MANAGEMENT_STANDARD.md** – Secret classification (Tier-1 Critical to Tier-4 Low), development/staging/production storage strategies, automated rotation (90/180-day cycles), vault integration, break-glass procedures, access audit
- **SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_STANDARD.md** – Seven supply chain layers (developer machine, source repo, build tools, infrastructure, artifact signing, container registry, deployment verification), threat scenarios and mitigations, dependency vulnerability correlation, supply chain monitoring
- **SBOM_GOVERNANCE_STANDARD.md** – SBOM generation (Syft, CycloneDX), NTIA compliance, vulnerability correlation, license scanning, storage in artifact repository, deployment verification, weekly reporting

**05_SAAS_AND_CLOUD_GOVERNANCE (3 new, from 5 total):**

- **MULTI_TENANCY_GOVERNANCE_STANDARD.md** – Tenancy models (Database/Schema/RLS), query isolation, cache isolation, backup isolation, audit logging per tenant, compliance validation
- **INFRASTRUCTURE_AS_CODE_GOVERNANCE.md** – Terraform/CloudFormation standards, policy-as-code (OPA/Rego), version control structure, CI/CD validation gates, drift detection, state management

**New Strategic Standards (2 new):**

- **ZERO_TRUST_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md** – Perimeter elimination, cryptographic identity (mTLS, SPIFFE), micro-segmentation, least privilege (RBAC), continuous verification, observability, complete logging
- **SLSA_FRAMEWORK_STANDARD.md** – SLSA levels 1-4 progression, verifiable provenance, supply chain attack resilience, Cosign/in-toto integration, hardened build systems, artifact signing, deployment verification

**All Layer 08 documents comply with EATGF signature template; implementation-grade technical standards.**

#### Cross-Layer Clarifications (1 new document)

- **API_GOVERNANCE_AUTHORITY_CLARIFICATION.md** – Clarifies relationship between Layer 05 API_GOVERNANCE_FRAMEWORK (strategic) and Layer 08 API_GOVERNANCE_STANDARD (operational); eliminates audit ambiguity about authority layering

**Impact:** Auditors understand clear parent/child relationship; Layer 05 is strategic policy; Layer 08 is tactical implementation.

### 🏗️ Architecture Stability

**v1.0-Foundation Guarantees:**

✅ **Immutable Baseline:** All documents tagged with git hash; never retroactively modified
✅ **No Breaking Changes:** Version updates within v1.0.x range maintain compatibility with Layer 02 controls
✅ **Documented Evolution:** Each evolution documented in EVOLUTION_HISTORY/ (Layer 07)
✅ **Standard References:** All standards reference NIST, ISO, OWASP, COBIT; external standards frozen

**Important:** v1.0-Foundation is governance architecture, not deployment automation. It provides:

- Reference models (not executable code)
- Policy templates (not deployed policies)
- Standards structures (not enforcement infrastructure)
- Framework guidance (not opinionated tool selection)

Organizations adopt and adapt EATGF to their context.

### 🔒 Security Considerations

**Framework Security Posture:**

- **No Secrets in Framework:** All frameworks credential-free; integrations assume organization-specific vault/HSM
- **No Default Weak Settings:** All templates assume zero-trust, cryptographic signing, audit logging
- **No Single Points of Failure:** Governance distributed across roles, no individual bypass capability
- **Audit-Defensible:** All 111 documents traceable to international standards (NIST, ISO, COBIT, OWASP)

---

## 🔄 Migration Path

**For v0.9 → v1.0 Users:**

1. **Review Layer 04 policies:** 5 new policies require organizational adoption
2. **Review Layer 06 standards:** Audit program integration required
3. **Review Layer 08 implementations:** CI/CD integration of new DevSecOps standards
4. **Run Framework Validation:** Use EATGF_FRAMEWORK_INDEX.md audit script
5. **No Breaking Changes:** v1.0 fully backward-compatible with v0.9 controls

---
