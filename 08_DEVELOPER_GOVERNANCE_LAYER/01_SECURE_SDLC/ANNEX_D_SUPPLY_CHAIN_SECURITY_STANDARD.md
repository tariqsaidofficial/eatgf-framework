## Relationship

This annex originally provided abbreviated supply chain security controls within the Secure SDLC domain. The comprehensive standard in Layer 08.03 now provides the complete implementation requirements including SBOM generation, dependency scanning, artifact provenance, and third-party risk evaluation.

All references to supply chain security controls should cite EATGF-DEV-SUP-01 and the Layer 08.03 document.
