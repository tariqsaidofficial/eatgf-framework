# EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY_AND_REPOSITORY_CONTROL_POLICY.md

**Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)**
Evidence Integrity & Repository Control Policy

---

**Document Type:** Operational Policy  
**Authority:** Chief Audit Officer / Governance Office  
**Effective Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Applies To:** All evidence stored in authorization of EATGF controls  
**Compliance:** Supports ISO 27001 Clause 7.5 (Documented Information Control)

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes controls to ensure that evidence of control implementation:

- **Remains unchanged** from date of upload through audit completion
- **Is traceable** to specific evidence owner and timestamp
- **Survives audit challenge** with proof of integrity
- **Meets auditor requirements** for non-repudiation

**Scope:** All evidence uploaded to Evidence Repository in support of MASTER_CONTROL_MATRIX.md controls

---

## 2. Evidence Repository Requirements

### 2.1 Three Mandatory Capabilities

The Evidence Repository (SharePoint, OneDrive, Confluence, Git, or equivalent) MUST provide:

#### Capability 1: Version History (Non-Destructive)

**Requirement:**
- Every file upload creates immutable, timestamped version record
- Previous versions retained indefinitely (minimum 7 years per control)
- No file can be deleted without IT audit trail
- Evidence Owner cannot "overwrite" – only upload new version

**Verification:**
- Repository administrator confirms: "Version history enabled, disabled deletion"
- Test: Upload PDF → Check version history → Previous versions accessible
- Audit trail: All uploads logged with timestamp + user ID

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Microsoft SharePoint:** Version History enabled (default), retention policies set
- ✅ **OneDrive for Business:** Restore previous versions enabled
- ✅ **Confluence:** Page history retained (all edits tracked)
- ✅ **Git:** Immutable commit history (cannot be altered post-sign)
- ✅ **AWS S3:** Versioning enabled, S3 Object Lock for immutability
- ❌ **Shared folder (\\server):** No version history → NOT APPROVED
- ❌ **Email attachment:** No audit trail → NOT APPROVED

---

#### Capability 2: Restricted Write Access (Role-Based)

**Requirement:**
- **Evidence Owners:** Can UPLOAD new evidence, READ own files, cannot DELETE
- **Control Owners:** Can READ all evidence for their control, cannot DELETE
- **Internal Auditors:** Can READ all evidence for audit scope, cannot DELETE
- **Governance Office:** Can READ all, manage folder structure, cannot DELETE evidence files
- **IT/Archive:** Only role that can DELETE (after 7-year retention expires)

**Implementation:**

| Repository | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **SharePoint** | Folder permissions: Evidence Owners=Contribute, Control Owners=Read, Auditors=Read, IT=Full Control |
| **OneDrive** | Shared folder with restricted permissions + audit logging |
| **Confluence** | Page restrictions: Contributors can edit own docs, Readers can view only |
| **Git** | Branch protection: Main branch locked, PRs require review, no force-push |
| **AWS S3** | IAM policies: Users have s3:PutObject (upload) but not s3:DeleteObject |

**Verification:**
- Test: Evidence Owner successfully uploads file
- Test: Evidence Owner attempts delete → DENIED (permission error)
- Test: Control Owner attempts delete → DENIED
- Audit trail: Failed delete attempts logged

---

#### Capability 3: Access Logging & Immutable Audit Trail

**Requirement:**
- Every action logged: date, time, user ID, action type (upload, download, delete, modify)
- Logs retained minimum 1 year (longer if evidence retention active)
- Logs themselves immutable (cannot be deleted or modified by regular users)
- Auditable by: Governance Office, Internal Audit, IT compliance

**Implementation:**

| Repository | Audit Trail Feature |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **SharePoint** | Audit Logs (Admin Center) – minimal 90 days |
| **OneDrive** | Microsoft 365 Audit Log – 90 days |
| **Confluence** | Activity Stream + Audit Log (Admin) – 30 days minimum |
| **Git** | Commit log + audit (git log) – indefinite |
| **AWS S3** | CloudTrail logging + S3 access logging |

**Verification:**
- Request: "Provide access log for file [name] from [date range]"
- Audit trail provided to: Governance Office, Chief Audit Officer, Finance (if needed)

---

## 3. Evidence Integrity Controls

### 3.1 Cryptographic Hashing (Optional, Recommended for High-Criticality Controls)

**When to Use:**
- Control: EDM (governance layer)
- Control: DSS-SEC-01, DSS-ENC-01 (access/encryption proof)
- Control: Any control where auditor may challenge file originality

**How It Works:**

Evidence Owner uploads PDF evidence of control compliance.

After upload, Evidence Owner:

1. Downloads file from repository
2. Calculates SHA256 hash:
   - Windows: `certutil -hashfile "C:\path\file.pdf" SHA256`
   - Mac: `shasum -a 256 /path/file.pdf`
   - Online: Use sha256online.com (if document is non-confidential)
3. Copies 64-character hex string
4. Pastes into EVIDENCE_REGISTER Column T (Evidence Hash)

**Hash example:**
```
a3e8c72b9f4b1e6dfc2a9d5e1b3c4f6a8e9d2c5a7b8e9f0d1c2a3b4e5f6a7b
```

**During Audit:**

Auditor retrieves evidence file and repeats hash calculation:
- If hash matches Column T → ✅ File unchanged since upload
- If hash differs → ⚠️ File modified after upload (investigate)

**Cost:**
- Each file: 30 seconds to calculate + paste hash
- Per audit cycle (35 controls): ~30 minutes total
- Result: Audit defensibility boost

---

### 3.2 Repository-Level Integrity (Built-In)

**What Repository Provides by Default:**

All three major repositories (SharePoint, OneDrive, Git) provide:

| Integrity Feature | How It Protects Evidence |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Version History** | All previous uploads preserved – auditor can verify file as-of date X |
| **Timestamp** | Every version marked with creation date + uploading user – proof of originality |
| **Access Logging** | Download/upload attempts recorded – auditor can see who accessed when |
| **Non-Repudiation** | User cannot claim "I didn't upload that" – logs prove they did |

**Example Audit Scenario:**

*Auditor challenge:* "This access control review seems outdated. When was it actually performed?"

*Defense:*
1. Open Evidence Repository
2. Filter version history for evidence file
3. Show: Created 01/15/2026, by [Evidence Owner Name]
4. Show: Access logs confirming no modifications since upload
5. If hash present: Show hash unchanged since upload
6. Conclusion: Evidence is contemporary, unmodified ✅

---

## 4. Evidence Repository Selection Guidance

### Recommended Repositories (Meet All 3 Requirements)

#### ✅ Microsoft SharePoint

**Why:** Enterprise standard, built-in version history, audit logging

**Setup:**
```
Create folder: /sites/governance/Evidence
Subfolder: /2026, /2027, etc. (by year)
Permissions:
  - Evidence Owners: Contribute
  - Control Owners: Read
  - Auditors: Read
  - IT: Full Control
Retention: 7 years (via retention policies)
```

**Cost:** Included in Microsoft 365

---

#### ✅ Git (for Development/Cloud Controls)

**Why:** Immutable commits, perfect audit trail, DevOps-native

**Setup:**
```
Repository: governance-evidence
Branch: main (protected, no force-push)
Folder structure:
  /2026/Q1/[Control]/evidence.pdf
  /2026/Q1/[Control]/evidence-hash.txt (optional)
```

**Cost:** Free (GitHub public or private)

---

#### ✅ AWS S3 (for Cloud Environments)

**Why:** Enterprise scale, versioning, CloudTrail logging

**Setup:**
```
Bucket: company-governance-evidence
Versioning: Enabled
Server-side encryption: Enabled
Access Logging: Enabled
S3 Object Lock: Optional (immutability enforcement)
```

**Cost:** Minimal (<$1/month for typical volume)

---

### ⚠️ Acceptable but Limited

#### Confluence Wiki

**Why:** Good for documents, limited version history
- ✅ Version history exists (30-day audit trail)
- ⚠️ Shorter audit retention than SharePoint
- ✅ Access logging available

**Use when:** Non-critical evidence, policy documents, reference material

**Not suitable for:** Critical evidence, direct control proof

---

### ❌ NOT Approved

#### Email Attachments
- ❌ No version history
- ❌ No access control
- ❌ Limited audit trail
- Risk: File can be "accidentally" replaced, auditor cannot verify originality

#### USB Drives / Local Folders
- ❌ No audit trail
- ❌ No access control
- ❌ Files can be deleted/modified
- Risk: Complete audit trail loss

#### Manual Paper Files
- ❌ No version control
- ❌ Physical tampering risk
- ⚠️ Acceptable ONLY if encrypted scanned + stored in approved digital repository afterward

---

## 5. Evidence Upload Procedure

### Step-by-Step Process (Evidence Owner)

**Week 2 (Data Population Cycle):**

1. **Prepare evidence:**
   - Ensure document in PDF format (or system export with timestamp)
   - Ensure signed/dated (if document-based)
   - Ensure file name descriptive: "Q1-2026-IAM-AccessReview-SIGNED.pdf"

2. **Calculate evidence hash (optional but recommended for High criticality):**
   ```
   Windows: certutil -hashfile "C:\path\file.pdf" SHA256
   Mac: shasum -a 256 /path/file.pdf
   Copy 64-char string
   ```

3. **Upload to approved repository:**
   - Navigate to: /governance/Evidence/[YEAR]/[MONTH]/
   - Upload file
   - Confirm: Version history shows new entry

4. **Record in EVIDENCE_REGISTER:**
   - Column G (Evidence Description): "Q1 2026 IAM Access Review – Signed PDF"
   - Column H (Evidence Location): URL/path to repository
   - Column I (Last Review Date): "01/15/2026"
   - Column T (Evidence Hash): Paste hash if calculated
   - (Columns J, L, U auto-populate via formulas)

5. **Notify Control Owner:**
   - Send: "Evidence uploaded for [Control ID]"
   - Reference: EVIDENCE_REGISTER row #
   - Action: Control Owner reviews, validates completeness

6. **Confirmation:**
   - Control Owner: "Validated ✅"
   - EVIDENCE_REGISTER Status (Column L): Auto-updates to "VALID"

---

## 6. Evidence Audit & Verification (During Audit Week)

### Auditor Verification Procedure

**Week 3 (Pilot Audit) & Weeks 5–6 (Full Audit):**

1. **Receive EVIDENCE_TRACKER export** from Governance Office

2. **For each control to audit:**

   a) **Check repository for evidence file:**
      - Navigate to folder for that control
      - Confirm file present & accessible
      - Check version history: "Created [date] by [owner name]"

   b) **If Column T has hash:**
      - Download file locally
      - Calculate hash on auditor's machine:
        ```
        Windows: certutil -hashfile "C:\Downloads\file.pdf" SHA256
        Mac: shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/file.pdf
        ```
      - Compare result to Column T
      - If match: ✅ File integrity confirmed
      - If mismatch: ⚠️ FILE MODIFIED AFTER UPLOAD → Escalate

   c) **Review evidence quality:**
      - Is evidence clear & legible?
      - Is evidence dated?
      - Is evidence signed/authorized (if required)?
      - Does evidence prove control operation?

   d) **Document findings:**
      - Auditor Notes (Column Q): "Evidence reviewed, confirmed integrity"
      - Status (Column L): Update to "VERIFIED" if audit passed

3. **If evidence integrity issue found:**
   - Escalate to Governance Office immediately
   - Corrective action: Evidence Owner re-uploads unmodified file
   - Root cause investigation: How was file modified?

## 9. Escalation for Evidence Integrity Issues

### If File Hash Mismatch Detected (During Audit)

**Severity:** CRITICAL (potential audit failure)

**Response:**

1. **Auditor:** Report immediately to Chief Audit Officer
2. **Chief Audit Officer:** Notify Governance Office
3. **Governance Office:** Contact Evidence Owner
4. **Investigation:**
   - When was file modified?
   - By whom?
   - Why was it modified?
   - Is modification authorized?
   - Should evidence be accepted or rejected?
5. **Corrective Action:**
   - If authorized modification: Document rationale
   - If unauthorized: Evidence rejected, new evidence required
   - Add corrective action to audit log

**Prevention:**
- More frequent auditing of this control
- Tighter repository access restrictions
- Hash verification mandatory for future cycles

---

### If Evidence File Deleted/Missing (During Audit)

**Severity:** CRITICAL (evidence unavailable for audit)

**Response:**

1. **Auditor:** Check repository version history
   - Can file be restored from version history? 
   - If yes: Restore file, audit proceeds
   - If no: Escalate immediately

2. **Governance Office:** Investigate deletion
   - Who deleted file?
   - When?
   - Authorization?
   - IT recovery possible?

3. **Corrective Action:**
   - Audit finding: "Evidence integrity control failure"
   - Remediation: Repository access restrictions tightened
   - Deadline: Implement within 30 days
   - Follow-up audit: Verify controls re-implemented

---

## 10. Compliance with ISO Standards

### ISO 27001 Clause 7.5 – Documented Information Control

This policy implements:

- ✅ A.7.5 – "Ensure documented information is adequately protected"
- ✅ Controlled storage (version history, immutability)
- ✅ Controlled access (role-based permissions)
- ✅ Evidence of implementation (audit trails)

### ISO 19011 – Evidence Requirements

This policy ensures:

- ✅ Evidence is retained for audit evaluation
- ✅ Evidence integrity can be verified
- ✅ Evidence chain of custody documented
- ✅ Auditor can challenge evidence authenticity

---

## 11. Retention & Archival

### 7-Year Retention Enforcement

- **Retention Period:** 7 years from Last Review Date (per Column S)
- **Archival Process:** After 7-year window:
  1. IT backup evidence to long-term storage
  2. Delete from active repository
  3. Document archival in Evidence Register
  4. Provide archived link if auditor requests after period ends

- **Exception:** If evidence related to unresolved finding, retain until finding closed + 1 year

---

## 12. Document Control
