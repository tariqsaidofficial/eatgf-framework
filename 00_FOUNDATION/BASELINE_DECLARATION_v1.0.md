## Executive Summary

**Date Issued:** February 13, 2026  
**Status:** 🔒 **BASELINE FROZEN** – Naming, versioning, and governance architecture locked

The Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF) has been officially designated, versioned, and frozen as v1.0-Foundation. All naming conventions, repository authority, and tag references are now locked and immutable.

---

## 1. Official Framework Identity (LOCKED)

### Full Legal Designation

```
Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)
```

### Official Abbreviation (MANDATORY)

```

**Effective Immediately** – All future references must use EATGF exclusively.

### Deprecated Names (No Longer Valid)

- ❌ enterprise-governance-framework (old folder name, archived)
- ❌ governance framework (informal, discontinued)
- ❌ AI governance framework (too narrow, avoided)
- ❌ control governance (too narrow, avoided)
- ❌ Any abbreviation other than EATGF (EGF, AGF, etc. invalid)

## 4. Baseline Immutability

**FROZEN Constraints:**

- 🔒 No structural changes to v1.0-Foundation are permitted
- 🔒 No modifications to v1.0 MCM, ISMS, or AIMS allowed
- 🔒 No retroactive amendments to v1.0 content
- ✅ Only forward-looking version increments (v1.1, v2.0) apply changes

**Rationale:** Baseline immutability ensures v1.0-Foundation remains a reliable reference point for organizations adopting EATGF and provides an audit-defensible governance anchor.

---

## 5. Post-v1.0 Versioning Rules

### Version Progression Path

```
EATGF-v1.0-Foundation (Feb 13, 2026) ← CURRENT BASELINE
    ↓
EATGF-v1.1-[Description] (IF refinements needed during operational phase)
    ↓
EATGF-v2.0-Edition-Deployment (IF Phase 2 passes compliance gates & Phase 3 authorized)
    ↓
EATGF-v2.1-Startup, v2.2-SaaS, v2.3-Enterprise (Edition-specific variants)
```

### Versioning Decision Criteria

| Change Type | Version Increment | Allowed on v1.0 | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Structural changes (new domains, MCM expansion) | Major (v2.0+) | ❌ No | Requires new baseline tag |
| Control clarifications, policy updates | Minor (v1.1, v1.2) | ❌ No | Create new v1.x tag if needed |
| Documentation improvements, examples | Patch (v1.0.1) | ❌ No | v1.0-Foundation immutable |
| Operational tuning per edition | Edition (v2.1, v2.2, v2.3) | ❌ No | Post-Phase 3 only |

### If Refinements Required During Operational Phase

**Scenario: Minor Clarifications Needed (Weeks 1–6)**

1. Document change request with business justification
2. Create new tag: `EATGF-v1.1-[Description]` (e.g., `EATGF-v1.1-Week-2-Refinements`)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with version history
4. Maintain v1.0-Foundation as baseline reference
5. Update documentation portal to reference v1.1

**Scenario: Major Changes Needed (Post-Phase 2)**

1. Architectural review required (internal governance review)
2. Cross-standard impact assessment (ISO/COBIT/NIST alignment check)
3. Formal approval gates before v2.0 baseline
4. Only authorized post-March 31 Phase 2 gate completion
5. v2.0 replaces v1.0 as production baseline

---

## 6. Effective Date & Baseline Anchor

**Official Effective Date:** February 13, 2026

**Production Implementation Date:** February 16, 2026 (Week 1 operational cycle begins)

**Next Governance Gate:** March 31, 2026 (Post-Phase 2 evaluation; Phase 3 authorization decision)

---

## 7. Attribution & Reference Format

**When referencing EATGF v1.0-Foundation, use:**

```
Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)
Version: 1.0 – Foundation Edition
Baseline Tag: EATGF-v1.0-Foundation

## 8. Governance Continuity

This baseline declaration establishes the authoritative governance anchor for all subsequent EATGF evolution, implementation, and assurance activities. It serves as:

- ✅ **Reference point** for adoption by organizations
- ✅ **Audit defensibility** against international standards
- ✅ **Version control anchor** for git tagging and release management
- ✅ **Governance continuity** across operational phases
- ✅ **Change control baseline** for future modifications
