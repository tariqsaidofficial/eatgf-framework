## 🎯 How to Use This Layer

**Governance Leaders:**
- ISMS_MANUAL_v1.0.md: Understand security system structure
- AIMS_MANUAL_v1.0.md: Understand AI governance procedures
- Use together to show dual management system architecture

**Security Managers / ISO 27001 Leads:**
- ISMS_MANUAL_v1.0.md is authoritative for all security procedures
- Use SoA template for audit preparation
- Trace all security procedures back to ISO 27001 clauses

**AI Governance / ML Ops Teams:**
- AIMS_MANUAL_v1.0.md governs AI model lifecycle
- Implement procedures for bias detection, monitoring, improvement
- Integrate with security procedures in ISMS

**Internal Auditors:**
- Audit ISMS compliance per ISO 27001:2022 framework
- Audit AIMS compliance per ISO 42001:2023 framework
- Use SoA as evidence tracking tool

**External Auditors / Certification Bodies:**
- ISMS_MANUAL_v1.0.md is primary audit reference for ISO 27001 certification
- AIMS_MANUAL_v1.0.md is primary audit reference for ISO 42001 certification
- Both demonstrate formal management system implementation

## 🔄 Integration with Other Layers

- **Layer 00 (Foundation):** Controls in MCM are implemented via ISMS + AIMS procedures
- **Layer 02 (Control Architecture):** ISMS + AIMS map to COBIT domains and NIST frameworks
- **Layer 04 (Policy Layer):** Policies are operationalized through ISMS + AIMS procedures
- **Layer 06 (Audit):** Audit program verifies ISMS + AIMS compliance
