## Authoritative SLA Matrix

**Source:** VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT_PROFILE.md (Layer 08 - Developer Governance)
**Authority:** NIST SSDF RV.1 + ISO 27001 A.8.16

### CRITICAL Severity

| Stage                  | SLA          | Definition                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Detection Notification | 15 minutes   | Alert team within 15 min of CVE discovery |
| Patch Application      | 1 hour       | Security patch must be available/applied  |
| Deployment             | 4 hours      | Patched version deployed to production    |
| Verification           | 24 hours     | Confirm stable operation in production    |
| **Total Time to Safe** | **24 hours** | Complete remediation end-to-end           |

**Escalation:** Immediate paging to on-call security engineer

**Example Timeline:**

- 2:00 PM: CVE detected (NVD)
- 2:15 PM: Alert sent to security team via Slack + PagerDuty
- 2:45 PM: Upstream provider releases patch
- 3:00 PM: Dependencies updated, rebuild triggered
- 6:00 PM: Patched container deployed to prod (4-hour mark)
- 2:00 PM next day: Verified stable (24-hour mark) 

---

### HIGH Severity

| Stage                  | SLA        | Definition                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Detection Notification | 1 hour     | Alert team within 1 hour                  |
| Patch Application      | 1 day      | Security patch availability checked daily |
| Deployment             | 3 days     | Patched version deployed within 3 days    |
| Verification           | 1 week     | Confirm stable operation for 1 week       |
| **Total Time to Safe** | **1 week** | Complete remediation end-to-end           |

**Escalation:** Escalate if patch pending >4 hours after availability

---

### MEDIUM Severity

| Stage                  | SLA         | Definition                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Detection Notification | 24 hours    | Alert team within 24 hours              |
| Patch Application      | 1 week      | Patch checked weekly                    |
| Deployment             | 2 weeks     | Patched version deployed within 2 weeks |
| Verification           | 1 month     | Monitor for 1 month post-deployment     |
| **Total Time to Safe** | **1 month** | Complete remediation end-to-end         |

**Treatment:** Track as tech debt in backlog

---

### LOW Severity

| Stage                  | SLA          | Definition                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Detection Notification | 1 week       | Alert team within 1 week        |
| Patch Application      | 1 month      | Patch checked monthly           |
| Deployment             | 3 months     | Batched with regular updates    |
| Verification           | None         | Deployed with standard release  |
| **Total Time to Safe** | **3 months** | Include in regular patch cycles |

**Treatment:** Backlog item for future releases
