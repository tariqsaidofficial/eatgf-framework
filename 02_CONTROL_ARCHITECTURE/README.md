# 02_CONTROL_ARCHITECTURE

**Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)**  
Control Architecture Layer – Control Alignment & Mapping

---

## 📋 Layer Purpose

The Control Architecture Layer defines the principles for how controls work, how they map across standards, and how risk is assessed. This layer bridges the control definitions (Layer 00) with the formal systems (Layer 01).
