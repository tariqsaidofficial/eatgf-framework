# 05_DOMAIN_FRAMEWORKS

**Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)**  
Domain Frameworks Layer – Specialized Governance

---

## 📋 Layer Purpose

The Domain Frameworks Layer extends EATGF into specialized domains where additional governance is needed beyond the core framework. Each domain adds controls and procedures specific to that technology area.

## 📂 Contents

### AI_GOVERNANCE_FRAMEWORK.md
- AI-specific governance extension
- AI/ML model lifecycle governance
- Bias detection and mitigation procedures
- Model performance monitoring
- Explainability and transparency requirements
- AI-specific risk assessment
- Extends AIMS (ISO 42001:2023) with operational detail

## 🎯 How to Use This Layer

**AI Directors / ML Leaders:**
- AI_GOVERNANCE_FRAMEWORK.md: Govern AI model lifecycle
- Implement bias detection and monitoring
- Ensure compliance with governance control framework
- Report AI governance metrics to governance council

**API Owners / Developers:**
- API_GOVERNANCE_FRAMEWORK.md: Implement API security
- Follow authentication/authorization standards
- Implement rate limiting and versioning
- Include in change control procedures

**Security Teams:**
- Both frameworks: Audit API and AI implementations
- Verify security controls are in place
- Monitor for compliance violations

**Governance Leaders:**
- Both frameworks: Report on domain-specific governance
- Track AI model inventory and compliance
- Track API inventory and security posture
