# PHASE_2_STABILIZATION_PLAN.md

**Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)**
Phase 2 Operational Validation – 6-Week Controlled Rollout

---

**Status:** ARCHIVED OPERATIONAL PLANNING DOCUMENT  
**Timeline:** 6 weeks (Feb 13 – Mar 31, 2026)  
**Classification:** Historical Reference – Phase 2 Implementation Record

---

##  Purpose & Context

This document captured the operational validation plan that shaped Phase 2 stabilization prior to Phase 3 deployment. It reflects the engineering discipline applied to framework validation before public release.

**The phase 2 stabilization approach (Build → Integrate → Stress-Test → Scale) proved effective and is retained as a reference for future governance validation cycles.**

### Key Planning Elements Documented

- Evidence Register deployment approach
- Audit scheduling and methodology
- Governance gates and decision criteria
- Success metrics for stabilization acceptance
- Role responsibilities during validation

### Implementation Status

Phase 2 stabilization was successfully completed Mar 31, 2026, with:
-  Evidence Register operationalized
-  Internal audit cycles validated
-  Framework proven operational
-  Management review approval secured

---

##  Why Stabilize Phase 2 Before Phase 3?

**Risk of proceeding directly to Phase 3:**
- Untested framework deployed widely
- Edition deployment multiplies complexity
- Errors magnified across multiple editions
- Public reference framework built on assumptions

**Correct approach (Engineering discipline):**

```
Build → Integrate → Stress-Test → Then Scale
```

This document captured the **stress-test plan** that validated the approach.

##  Phase 2 Stabilization Framework (As Planned)

### Timeline Overview

```
WEEK 1: Deploy Evidence Register
WEEK 2: Populate High-Criticality Controls
WEEK 3: Pilot Audit (10 Controls)
WEEK 4: Gap Hardening & Refinement
WEEK 5-6: Full Internal Audit Cycle
Final Gate: Compliance Validation & Phase 3 Decision
```

##  Governance Approach

### Gates & Decision Points

**Week 1 Gate:** Can the Evidence Register be operationalized?  
**Week 2 Gate:** Can Evidence Owners enter data correctly?  
**Week 3 Gate:** Does the framework survive pilot audit?  
**Week 4 Gate:** Is framework hardened for full deployment?  
**Week 5–6 Gate:** Is framework ready for external auditor?  

**Final Gate (Week 6):**
- Overall compliance ≥90%
- Critical findings <5
- Management review completed
- Corrective action plan approved

##  Success Metrics (As Defined)

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Overall Compliance % | ≥90% | Evidence coverage validation |
| Critical Controls 100% | ≥100% | Special focus on key controls |
| Evidence Completeness | ≥95% | Data quality assurance |
| Formula Accuracy | 100% | Register technical validation |
| Audit Findings Severity | <5 critical | Manageable remediation |
| Corrective Action Closure | 100% | Follow-through verification |

---

##  Roles & Responsibilities (As Planned)

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|-----------------|
| **Governance Office** | Register oversight, gate management, escalation |
| **Evidence Owners** | Data population, audit response |
| **Control Owners** | Evidence validation, finding response |
| **Internal Auditor** | Pilot & full audit execution (per ISO 19011) |
| **External Consultant** | Framework validation, recommendations |
| **CISO / CAO** | Executive oversight, management review sign-off |
| **Steering Committee** | Governance approval, Phase 3 decision |
