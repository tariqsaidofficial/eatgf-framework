# 07_REFERENCE_AND_EVOLUTION

**Enterprise AI-Aligned Technical Governance Framework (EATGF)**  
Reference & Evolution Layer – Governance Development History & Documentation

---

## 📋 Layer Purpose

The Reference & Evolution Layer documents the governance framework's development history and strategic planning. This is a **reference-only layer** providing context for how EATGF governance architecture was built and planned; it is not part of the authoritative governance framework itself.

---

## 📂 Layer Organization

This layer is organized into four subdirectories serving distinct purposes:

---

### **EVOLUTION_HISTORY/**
**Governance Architecture Evolution & Control Development History**

Documents the historical development of EATGF governance architecture and control framework expansion.

**Contents:**
- **PHASE_1.5_CONTROL_EXPANSION.md** – Historical record of Master Control Matrix expansion from 21 to 35 controls (archived reference)
- **PHASE_2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** – Historical record of management system layer establishment: ISMS (ISO 27001), AIMS (ISO 42001), audit procedures (archived reference)

**Status:** Archived evolution documentation. Current authoritative governance framework is in [Layers 00–06](../).

---

### **FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP/**
**Implementation & Deployment Planning**

Documents governance deployment roadmap and operational planning approaches.

**Contents:**
- **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** – 12-month governance deployment roadmap with phase-by-phase delivery plan, success metrics, and edition-specific timelines (Startup/SaaS/Enterprise)
- **PHASE_2_STABILIZATION_PLAN.md** – Historical operational validation plan for Phase 2 stabilization cycle (archived reference; successfully completed Mar 31, 2026)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md is active reference for deployment planning. PHASE_2_STABILIZATION_PLAN documents historical approach.

---

### **DECISION_RECORDS/**
**Strategic Governance Decisions**

Documents key strategic decisions in framework evolution and architecture choices.

**Contents:**
- **PHASE_2_vs_PHASE_3_DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md** – Strategic decision record: Why Phase 2 stabilization before Phase 3 deployment (professional engineering discipline; test before scale). Archived decision documentation showing governance methodology evolution.

**Status:** Archived decision record demonstrating governance validation approach.

---

### **HISTORICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS/**
**Operational Execution Materials – Phase 2 Implementation**

Reference-only materials documenting Phase 2 operational execution and implementation specifications. **These materials are NOT part of the authoritative governance framework.**

**Contents:**
- **EVIDENCE_REGISTER_MASTER.md** – Evidence register specification (20-column architecture, MCM-centric)
- **EVIDENCE_REGISTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** – Excel setup & implementation guide
- **EVIDENCE_REGISTER_EXCEL_BUILD_SPECIFICATION.md** – Technical developer specifications
- **EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY_AND_REPOSITORY_CONTROL_POLICY.md** – SHA256 hashing, access controls for evidence
- **WEEK_1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md** – Development day-by-day specifications
- **WEEK_1_STATUS.md** – Status tracking template
- **PHASE_2_WEEK_1_GO_APPROVAL.md** – Executive go/no-go approval
- **PHASE_2_FINAL_GO_NO_GO_GATE.md** – Week 1 validation criteria
- **README.md** – Operation archive index

**Status:** Reference-only materials for understanding Phase 2 implementation approach. Current operational guidance is in authoritative framework [Layers 00–06](../).

## 🎯 How to Use This Layer

**Governance Leaders:**
- FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md → Overall deployment strategy
- EVOLUTION_HISTORY/ → Understand governance architecture evolution journey
- DECISION_RECORDS/ → Understand strategic governance methodology choices

**Executives / Steering Committee:**
- FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md → Assess governance deployment timeline
- DECISION_RECORDS/ → Understand framework validation approach & governance discipline

**Implementation Teams (Framework Adopters):**
- FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md → Your governance deployment roadmap
- HISTORICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS/ → Reference examples of evidence tracking & implementation approaches
- EVOLUTION_HISTORY/ → Understand why governance architecture was designed this way

**Governance Researchers / External Parties:**
- EVOLUTION_HISTORY/ → Understand how EATGF governance was developed
- DECISION_RECORDS/ → See professional engineering discipline applied to governance framework validation
- FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP/ → Understand deployment approaches and success criteria

---

## 🔄 Integration with Other Layers

- **Layers 00–06:** Describe the authoritative governance framework (what was built, why, how it works)
- **Layer 07:** Documents how the framework was built historically and provides deployment guidance
- **Feedback loops:** Historical implementation experience informs framework improvements & v1.1+ evolution

---

## 📌 Important Notes

### These Materials Are NOT Normative

Layer 07 provides **context and history**, not governance authority.

For authoritative governance requirements, consult:
- **[00_FOUNDATION](../00_FOUNDATION/)** – Framework authority and control inventory
- **[01_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS](../01_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS/)** – ISO-aligned management system specifications
- **[02_CONTROL_ARCHITECTURE](../02_CONTROL_ARCHITECTURE/)** – Control definitions and mappings
- **[03_GOVERNANCE_MODELS](../03_GOVERNANCE_MODELS/)** – Governance maturity and performance models
- **[04_POLICY_LAYER](../04_POLICY_LAYER/)** – Formal governance policies
- **[05_DOMAIN_FRAMEWORKS](../05_DOMAIN_FRAMEWORKS/)** – Domain-specific governance (AI, API)
- **[06_AUDIT_AND_ASSURANCE](../06_AUDIT_AND_ASSURANCE/)** – Audit methodology & assurance framework

### Phase References Are Historical

This layer contains references to governance development phases (Phase 1.5, Phase 2, Phase 3) **for historical context only**. These are archived evolution stages of the framework, not operational deployment phases.

For current deployment guidance, refer to: **[FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](FRAMEWORK_ROADMAP/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)**
