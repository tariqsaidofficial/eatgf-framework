##  What Was Added (Last 24 Hours)

### 1. Evidence Integrity Control Layer

**Added to:** EVIDENCE_REGISTER_EXCEL_BUILD_SPECIFICATION.md

-  **Column T:** Evidence Hash (SHA256 cryptographic proof)
-  **Column U:** Evidence Integrity Status (VERIFIED / TAMPERED / N/A)
-  **Hash verification procedure:** Step-by-step for Evidence Owners & Auditors
-  **Purpose:** Prove evidence file was NOT modified after upload

**Why Added:** Security best practice for reference framework (auditor-defensible)

---

### 2. Evidence Integrity & Repository Control Policy

**Created:** EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY_AND_REPOSITORY_CONTROL_POLICY.md

-  **Repository requirements:** Version history, write restrictions, access logging
-  **Evidence upload procedure:** Step-by-step
-  **Auditor verification:** How to check file integrity during audit
-  **Escalation procedures:** If integrity violation detected
-  **Approved repositories:** SharePoint , OneDrive , Git , AWS S3 , Confluence 
-  **Implementation checklist:** Pre-Week 1 verification steps

**Why Created:** Ensures evidence physical integrity before starting pilot audit

##  GO/NO-GO GATE – 3-Factor Check

### Factor 1: Architecture Complete 

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| ISMS Manual (ISO 27001) |  Complete |
| AIMS Manual (ISO 42001) |  Complete |
| Internal Audit Procedure (ISO 19011) |  Complete |
| Evidence Register Specification |  Complete |
| Evidence Register Excel Build Spec |  Complete (+ Integrity Layer Added) |
| Phase 2 Stabilization Plan |  Complete |
| Evidence Integrity Policy |  Complete |

**Verdict:**  READY

---

### Factor 2: Repository Verified?

**Question:** Does your Evidence Repository support these 3 capabilities?

1. **Version History** – Every upload creates timestamped version (no overwrite)
   - SharePoint:  Yes (built-in)
   - OneDrive:  Yes (built-in)
   - Git:  Yes (immutable commits)
   - AWS S3:  Yes (versioning setting)
   - Confluence:  Yes (page history)
   - Shared Folder (\\server):  NO – must change

2. **Restricted Write Access** – Only authorized users can upload
   - All repositories above:  Yes (permission-based)
   - Email/USB:  NO – no access control

3. **Access Logging** – Who accessed file, when, what action
   - SharePoint:  Yes (audit logs)
   - OneDrive:  Yes (access logs)
   - Git:  Yes (commit logs)
   - AWS S3:  Yes (CloudTrail)
   - Confluence:  Yes (activity stream)

**Action Required:** 
-  If ALL 3 YES → Week 1 starts Monday 
-  If ANY NO → STOP, remediate repository per Policy Section 5 (1–2 days) → Then restart Week 1

---

### Factor 3: Teams Prepared?

**Questions:**

- [ ] Evidence Owners identified & contacted? (8 people for Week 2 controls)
- [ ] Control Owners identified & contacts confirmed?
- [ ] Internal Auditor assigned for Week 3 pilot?
- [ ] Repository admin notified (permissions, logging setup)?
- [ ] Training scheduled for Wed, Feb 17?

**Action Required:**
-  If ALL checked → Week 1 ready 
-  If ANY not checked → Coordinate Monday morning, no delay to build

---

##  FINAL GO/NO-GO DECISION

### If All 3 Factors = GO 

**Verdict:** Phase 2 Stabilization Week 1 Approved

**Start Date:** Monday, February 16, 2026

**Sequence:**

```
Mon–Tue (Feb 16–17):  Excel workbook build (developer)
Wed (Feb 17):         Training sessions (30-45 min each)
Thu (Feb 18):         Repository access testing
Fri (Feb 19):         Test controls loaded, formulas verified
                      → Week 1 Gate PASS 

Week 2 begins:        Load 8 high-criticality controls with real evidence
```

---

### If Any Factor = NO 

**Verdict:** Hold Phase 2 Stabilization Week 1

**Root Cause:** [Specify which factor]

**Remediation:**
- Repository issue → IT: 1–2 days to fix per policy
