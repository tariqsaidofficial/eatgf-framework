- [ ] V5.26: All attendee list collected + signatures

**Gate Decision:**

- ✅ **PASS (Go to Week 2)** – All 26 checkboxes completed
- ❌ **FAIL (Do NOT Proceed)** – Any item unchecked
  - Identify root cause
  - Remediate same day (Friday afternoon)
  - Retry validation
  - If still failure → Escalate to CISO + defer Week 2

**Expected Completion:** EOD Friday, Feb 20  
**Acceptance Criteria:** ≥26/26 checkboxes ✅ PASS OR escalation documented

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Excel formula errors | Week 2 blocked | Developer tests all formulas + dry run with dummy data |
| SharePoint permission misconfiguration | Delete allowed (integrity violation) | Repository Admin double-checks RBAC + test role access |
| Retention policy failure to apply | Evidence lost after 7 years | Purview compliance lock prevents disabling |
| Team training scheduled but people absent | Operator error during Week 2 | Send calendar invites by Friday EOD + reminder 24h before |
| Hash verification tool unavailable (Windows/Mac) | Can't calculate SHA256 | Pre-test tool availability; have backup tool ready (PowerShell + shasum) |
