## 1. PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

This model defines key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring governance effectiveness.

### Core Metrics Hierarchy

```
Strategic KPIs (Board Level)
├── Tactical KPIs (Leadership Level)
│   ├── Operational KPIs (Team Level)
│   └── Process Metrics (Execution Level)
└── Risk Metrics (Risk Oversight)
```

## 2. STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

### KPI 1: Compliance Score

**Definition:** Percentage of applicable regulatory requirements met

**Target:** 100% (Critical controls) / 95% (Standard controls)

**Frequency:** Monthly  
**Owner:** Compliance Officer

**Calculation:**
```
(Met Requirements / Total Requirements) × 100

Example:
- Total requirements: 200
- Fully met: 190
- Partially met: 8
- Not met: 2

Score: (190 + 8×0.5) / 200 = 96%
```

**Trending:**
- 95%+ = Green (On track)
- 85-94% = Yellow (Attention needed)
- <85% = Red (Critical)

---

### KPI 2: Risk Mitigation Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of identified risks with approved mitigation plans

**Target:** 100% for critical/high risks, 80% for medium

**Frequency:** Quarterly  
**Owner:** Chief Risk Officer

**Dashboard Segment:**
```
Red Risks (Critical): 3 total
├── With mitigation plans: 3 (100%) ✅
├── Avg risk score reduction: 25%
└── Residual risk acceptable: Yes

Orange Risks (High): 8 total
├── With mitigation plans: 8 (100%) ✅
