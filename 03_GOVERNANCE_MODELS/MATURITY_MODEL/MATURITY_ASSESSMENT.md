## 1. MATURITY ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW

The governance maturity model measures organizational capability across 5 core dimensions:

1. **Process Maturity** - How well are processes defined and standardized?
2. **People Capability** - Do teams have required skills and knowledge?
3. **Technology Integration** - Are tools and systems effectively integrated?
4. **Compliance & Audit** - Is there evidence of compliance?
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Are we learning and optimizing?

### Maturity Levels

| Level              | Status    | Characteristics                    |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **1 - Initial**    | ⚫ Red    | Ad-hoc, reactive, undocumented     |
| **2 - Developing** | 🟠 Orange | Processes documented, inconsistent |
| **3 - Defined**    | 🟡 Yellow | Standardized, measured             |
| **4 - Managed**    | 🟢 Green  | Measured, controlled               |
| **5 - Optimized**  | 🟣 Purple | Continuous improvement             |
